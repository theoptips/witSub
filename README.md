# Past, Present State, Future State, Next Step, Current Issues
Right only the weekly planner Monday sub list is implemented for hackathon demo purpose.
Next step is easy to implement for all days. Wit.ai does not need retraining. Extrapolates well thanks to the build in datetime entity. 

*Cool Feature* It will be SO MUCH FUN, when time permits, to implement the bubble tracker on the bottom right. 

*Cool Feature* The next step for RocketJournal is to implement the cool bullet marketing in Bullet Journal : o for events, â€¢ for tasks, * for important, - for notes. It is so much fun. It is actually very easy with css custom bullet. [Custom Bullet](https://web.dev/css-marker-pseudo-element/). Contact me. I can tell you all about optanovo@gmail.com

Providing for sample utterances. Wit.ai is a convenient one shot or few shot NLP model, it associates some keywords with message_body or datetime, even if it is actually ordinal,for example "the first item" is parsed as entity datetime because of the keyword the. Removing the keyword "first", it can parse as ordinal. 

A trick I used in this project is to call wit.ai twice. Once for the entire input, then for the message_body input to identify the ordinal entity. Ideally, wit.ai is smart enough to associate ordinal value with all the remove intents but right now it is not automatically doing so. Despite adding many sample utterances.
